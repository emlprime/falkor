h1. GOAL:
Have a task manager that can replace Jira but which can interface with Jira so that management is satisfied.

h1. STRATEGY:
Create a local repository of tasks and sync the results with Jira as the backend.
Focus on being able to create near term goals. The closer you get to the present, the more granular and defined the tickets become.


h1. TEST CASES:
I can create several Projects.
I can log in as myself (or others)
I can see my list of Projects.
I can switch between Projects easily.
I can see a brief description for the next few Quarters of my project.
I can focus on the current Quarter.
I can see a brief description for the Releases for the current quarter of my project.
I can see any prior releases in the current Quarter.
I can focus on the current Release.
I can see a brief description of the Sprints in my current Release.
I can see any prior sprints in the current Release.
I can focus on the current Sprint.
I can see a list of demo goals.
Each demo goal has an owner assigned to it.
Some goals may have supporters assigned to them.
There is one column for each available work day for any of the Assigned Owners.
Filled work days will have a milestone which calls out a falsifiable demo goal.
Each work day has a blank icon that indicates it's available for work.
Each milestone has a description, an estimate, and an actual.
Milestones can be crept, which increases their scope by one day.
Creeping a Milestone converts the Milestone at the end to a Millstone.
Millstones are displayed in a separate area.
Multi-day Milestones may be shrunk if they are demoed earlier than expected. Milestones to the right will pull back.
If all Milestones are fulfilled and it is not the end of the week, the owner may choose a Millstone to help with.
Sprint milestones display a progress based on how many of their daily milestones are fulfilled.
A burndown chart is display indicating the total number of planned Milestones and the total number of completed Milestones.
Escalations which interrupt the sprint get flagged as unplanned.
Interrupts get indicates as below the line in the burndown chart and indicate a failure in planning or quality.
Milestones indicate their status as TODO (Planned), DOING (Active), or DONE (Demoed).
